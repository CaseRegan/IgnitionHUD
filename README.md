# IgnitionHUD

Simple Chrome extension that records HUD stats while playing on Ignition Casino in your browser. If you have the extension active, it will start automatically when you visit the poker section of IgnitionCasino.eu and display draggable stats popups as soon as a hand has been completed.

Current features:
- A variety of useful stats (VPIP, PFR, 3bet, hands played)
- Multitable support
- Automatic, draggable popups

TODO list:
- Other important stats (cbet, agg)
- Automatically detecting table size (very easy I'm just lazy)
- Bug fixes (there are bugs related to the stats so they may be slightly off -- I'm a busy guy but will get around to fixing these)
- UI fixes/improvements (popups sometimes get lost offscreen when opening/closing tables and there is an issue with dragging them)
- Errors when loading into a blank table (with no game). Unclear is these actually cause any problems though.
